# Overview

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Amnesty Scheme in India is a government initiative designed to provide relief to taxpayers who have defaulted on their GST return filings [1][2]. Implemented under Section 128A of the CGST Act, the scheme aims to reduce the compliance burden by waiving or reducing penalties, interest, and late fees associated with overdue returns [3][4]. This allows businesses, including small and medium-sized enterprises, to regularize their compliance status without the full financial burden of penalties [3][5]. The scheme fosters better compliance, reduces financial burdens, and streamlines tax operations [6].
The primary objective of the GST Amnesty Scheme is to encourage non-compliant taxpayers to file their pending GST returns [3]. By offering a reduction or complete waiver of late fees, interest, and penalties, the government aims to widen the tax base and improve overall tax compliance rates [3][7]. Several iterations of the scheme have been introduced to address challenges faced by taxpayers, particularly those related to technical difficulties and the initial teething problems following the implementation of GST in 2017 [8]. For example, one scheme specifically targeted relief for the financial years 2017-18 to 2019-20 [8].
The GST Amnesty Scheme also aims to reduce litigation and expedite the setup of the GST Appellate Tribunal [9]. By providing a mechanism for dispute resolution and encouraging compliance, the scheme helps minimize the administrative burden of managing non-fraud cases [10][11]. The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has played a key role in introducing and administering these schemes to resolve past GST-related disputes [12].

# Eligibility Criteria

The GST Amnesty Scheme, effective from November 1, 2024 [13], provides relief to taxpayers who meet specific criteria [8]. Generally, the scheme targets businesses that have failed to file their GSTR-3B, GSTR-1, or other statutory GST returns for financial years starting from 2017-18 to 2019-20 [8][14], and in some cases, even later [1]. Small taxpayers, numbering approximately 1.5 million, are expected to benefit from this scheme [1]. Assessees who merged from previous laws may also be considered eligible [15].
To qualify for the amnesty, taxpayers must fully pay their outstanding tax dues by March 31, 2025 [4][16][12][17]. Applications for waivers must be submitted before June 30, 2025 [4][12][18]. The scheme applies to taxpayers who have outstanding tax payments pertaining to notices under Section 73(1) or statements under Section 73(3) of the GST Act [19][8]. A show cause notice under Section 73(1) or a statement under Section 73(3) also makes one eligible for waiver of interest and/or penalty [8].
However, the scheme excludes certain demands, such as those related to erroneous refunds [13][16]. Furthermore, to avail the benefit, any appeal or writ petition filed before an Appellate Authority, Appellate Tribunal, or a court must be withdrawn [12][20]. Taxpayers may need to submit a screenshot of their appeal withdrawal application to be eligible [18]. The scheme operates on an "all or nothing" basis, requiring taxpayers to pay the entire outstanding tax demand to avail the waiver, without allowing for partial payments or disputes [12].

# Scheme Details

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Amnesty Scheme 2024 was introduced to reduce the compliance burden on individuals and businesses [21]. It aims to provide relief to taxpayers facing interest and penalties on GST tax demands [22], particularly those affected by initial implementation challenges and technical difficulties [8]. The scheme is enacted vide Finance (No. 2) Act 2024 [23].
The scheme provides a conditional waiver of interest and penalties for tax demands issued under Section 73 of the CGST Act [24] [25]. This allows taxpayers to settle outstanding dues by paying the tax amount due by a specified deadline [24]. The scheme is applicable to both registered and unregistered individuals who have not filed their GST returns for specific periods [26]. It offers an opportunity to clear past liabilities without facing penalties, interest, or prosecution [26].
The GST Amnesty Scheme primarily applies to the financial years 2017-18, 2018-19, and 2019-20 [25] [14] [4], waiving interest under Section 50, penalties, or both [4]. To qualify for the amnesty, the tax demand as per the notice or order is required to be paid on or before March 31, 2025 [21] [27] [17] [28] [16]. This scheme is effective from November 1, 2024 [13] [22]. Taxpayers are advised to take advantage of this mechanism [29]. The last date for availing the benefits of interest & penalty waiver under GST is 31st March 2025 [30]. The deadline for filing applications under the Amnesty Scheme is June 30, 2025 [29] [18].
However, the scheme excludes certain demands, such as those related to erroneous refunds [13] [16]. A key condition is that no appeal should be pending against the demand order to avail the waiver under Section 128A [20].

# Application Process

The application process for the GST Amnesty Scheme involves several key steps and considerations for eligible taxpayers seeking a waiver of penalties and interest on outstanding tax dues [31] [6] [32] [33]. The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) introduced this scheme to resolve past GST-related disputes [12].
**Eligibility and Deadlines:** To qualify for the amnesty scheme, taxpayers must have been assessed under Section 73 of the CGST Act (non-fraudulent cases) and received GST demand notices or orders for the financial years 2017-18 to 2019-20 [4]. The scheme applies to interest and penalties arising between July 1, 2017, and March 31, 2020 [4]. Taxpayers must fully pay the outstanding tax dues by March 31, 2025 [4] [16] [17]. The deadline for submitting applications for waivers is June 30, 2025 [4] [29].
**Form SPL-02:** A crucial part of the application involves filing GST Form SPL-02 [31] [32] [34]. This form is used to apply for a waiver of penalty, interest, or both, levied by the authority as part of a tax demand [32]. A key benefit of using Form SPL-02 is the potential reduction in the financial burden [32].
**Step-by-Step Process for SPL-02:**
1.  **Login:** Access the GST portal [32] [35].
2.  **Navigate:** Go to 'Services', then 'User Services', and select 'My Applications' [35]. Choose 'Apply for Waiver Scheme under Section 128A' in the 'Application type' dropdown [36].
3.  **Upload Documents:** Taxpayers need to upload DRC-03 documents for each voluntary payment made outside the portal [32]. Table 7 of GST SPL-01 provides details of required documents and proofs [13].
4.  **Submission:** Ensure all required information and documents are accurately submitted before the deadline [4] [29].
**Important Considerations:**
*   The scheme excludes certain demands, such as those related to erroneous refunds [13] [16].
*   The department may issue a notice (GST SPL-04) stating reasons for potential rejection or any short payment of tax [37].
*   Applicants must submit their reply within one month, along with supporting documents like tax payment proof [4]. GST SPL-05 is issued to conclude proceedings if the reply is satisfactory [4].
*   Taxpayers should not miss the deadline of March 31, 2025, for availing the benefits of interest and penalty waiver [30].

# Impact and Effectiveness

The GST Amnesty Scheme aims to reduce the compliance burden for individuals and businesses [21]. It provides relief to taxpayers facing challenges and technical difficulties, particularly those affected during the financial years 2017-18 to 2019-20 [8]. By waiving interest and penalties, the scheme offers substantial financial relief [38], potentially equaling or exceeding the outstanding tax amount [38]. This can lead to cost savings for small and medium-sized enterprises [5].
The scheme is designed to encourage defaulters to become compliant, thereby improving overall tax compliance rates [7]. It also aims to reduce litigation and expedite the setup of the GST Appellate Tribunal [9]. By settling outstanding dues and regularizing compliance without heavy penalties, businesses are encouraged to participate [4]. The Amnesty Scheme minimizes the administrative burden of managing non-fraud cases, enabling the government to lower fines and late fees [10]. Taxpayers also benefit from not having to pay hefty late fees, which can discourage them from filing pending GSTR-3B returns [17]. Furthermore, the scheme helps avoid future legal disputes [5] and protects against GST Registration cancellation [5].
However, some argue that issue-based settlements, rather than notice or order-based settlements, could further assist businesses in contesting issues where they have a strong case [39]. Some taxpayers, especially small businesses, may find the eligibility criteria and application process complex [7].

# Challenges and Criticisms

While the GST Amnesty Scheme aims to ease the burden on taxpayers and improve compliance [7][21][11], it faces several challenges and criticisms.
One significant issue is the complexity involved in understanding the eligibility criteria and the application process, particularly for small businesses [7]. The filing procedure can be intricate [29], potentially deterring some taxpayers from participating [6].
Another point of concern is the limited timeframe for availing the scheme [6]. This can create pressure on taxpayers to quickly assess their eligibility and complete the necessary paperwork, potentially leading to errors or missed opportunities. Furthermore, a lack of awareness about the scheme among taxpayers can hinder its effectiveness [6].
Some critics suggest that the scheme could be improved by allowing for issue-based settlements rather than solely focusing on settlements based on notices or orders [39]. This would enable businesses to contest specific issues where they have a strong case [39]. Restrictions on input tax credit may also pose a challenge for some businesses [6].

# Comparison with Previous Schemes

The GST Amnesty Scheme is not the first initiative aimed at easing the compliance burden for taxpayers in India [40]. The government, through the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), has previously introduced similar schemes to address non-filers and provide relief from penalties and interest [40]. These schemes often arise from the recognition of "teething troubles and technical difficulties" faced by taxpayers [8].
While the core purpose of these schemes remains consistent – reducing compliance burdens and encouraging adherence to GST regulations [21] [11] – each scheme may differ in its specific provisions, eligibility criteria, and timeframe [41] [6]. For instance, some schemes focus on specific forms like GSTR-4, GSTR-9, and GSTR-10 [41], while others target outstanding tax payments related to notices under Section 73(1) or statements under Section 73(3) of the CGST Act [19]. A key feature of many amnesty schemes is the conditional waiver or reduction of interest and penalties [41] [11] [38] [5], offering substantial financial relief to taxpayers [38]. The 53rd GST Council Meeting even proposed inserting a new section in the CGST Act for conditional waivers [37].
Eligibility criteria can also vary. Some schemes consider assessees who merged from previous tax laws as eligible [15]. Understanding the specific eligibility criteria and application process for each scheme can be complex, particularly for small businesses [7]. Therefore, taxpayers need to carefully review the details of each scheme to determine their eligibility and the potential benefits [7].

# Legal Framework

The GST Amnesty Scheme in India is primarily governed by Section 128A of the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Act, 2017 [42][43]. This section introduces an amnesty scheme aimed at reducing the financial burden on taxpayers by waiving interest and penalties on outstanding tax demands [42]. The scheme is designed to reduce litigation and expedite the establishment of the GST Appellate Tribunal [9].
The 53rd GST Council Meeting proposed the insertion of this section to allow for conditional waivers of interest and penalties [37]. Notification No. 17/2024 - Central Tax specifically outlines the GST Amnesty Scheme 2024, which provides relief to businesses struggling with past GST liabilities by waiving interest and penalties on defaults under Section 73 of the CGST Act [44].
The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has issued circulars clarifying various aspects of the amnesty scheme under Section 128A [39]. These circulars address issues related to the waiver of interest and penalties [39]. Furthermore, the CBIC has issued notifications to amend rules related to the GST Amnesty Scheme [45][46]. For example, Notification No. 11/2025 introduces key changes, including partial appeal withdrawal options and clarifications on refunds for past payments [47]. The CBIC also announced an amnesty scheme through Notification 07/2023, dated March 31, 2023, which provides a waiver of late fees [8].

# Examples and Case Studies

While specific, publicly available case studies detailing the application of the GST Amnesty Scheme are limited, the general principles and potential benefits can be illustrated through hypothetical examples. These examples highlight how businesses might leverage the scheme to rectify past errors and reduce their compliance burden [21].
Consider a business that inadvertently made errors in their GST returns, resulting in overdue payments and accruing penalties [6]. Under the GST Amnesty Scheme, this business could file the overdue returns and potentially receive a waiver of interest and penalties, depending on the specific provisions of the scheme and their eligibility [37]. This allows them to correct errors without facing severe financial repercussions [6].
Another scenario involves a business facing disputes related to notices or orders issued by the GST authorities. While the ideal scenario would be an issue-based settlement allowing businesses to contest specific points [39], the amnesty scheme provides a mechanism to settle the overall dues related to the notice by paying the principal amount and potentially receiving waivers on interest and penalties [21].
These examples demonstrate the potential benefits of the GST Amnesty Scheme in providing a second chance for taxpayers to correct errors and reduce their compliance burden [6]. Businesses should carefully evaluate their specific circumstances and the provisions of the scheme to determine the optimal approach [38].
