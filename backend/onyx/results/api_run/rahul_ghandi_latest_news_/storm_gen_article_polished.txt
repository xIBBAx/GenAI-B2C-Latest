He has held several key positions within the party, including Vice President from 2013 to 2016 [1]. He then served as President of the INC from 2017 to 2019, succeeding his mother, Sonia Gandhi [1]. During his time as President, he spearheaded internal reforms aimed at increasing youth participation and breaking the hold of entrenched elites [33].
In 2024, Gandhi was serving as the 12th Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha [1][31]. This is the first time in ten years that the Lok Sabha will have a Leader of Opposition [3]. As Leader of the Opposition, Gandhi leads the opposition parties in debates and discussions, questioning the government's actions [4]. He also participates in the selection of bureaucrats for key posts [5][6]. The role is seen as providing a voice for the people in Parliament by raising their issues [3].

# Key Political Activities and Initiatives

Rahul Gandhi has been actively involved in several key political activities and initiatives, particularly focusing on connecting with the Indian populace and addressing issues of justice and unity. Two prominent examples are the Bharat Jodo Yatra and the Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra.
The **Bharat Jodo Yatra** ("Unite India March"), was a significant campaign led by Rahul Gandhi and the Indian National Congress (INC) [7]. Gandhi stated that the aim of the Yatra was to unite the people against what he described as an atmosphere of hatred created by the BJP and the RSS [9]. Some sources suggest that the Yatra, while impactful, may have been "wearing thin" as an electoral supplement [34]. The Yatra itself has been described as a profound and beautiful experience for Gandhi [26].
Building upon the foundation of the Bharat Jodo Yatra, the **Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra** ("Unite India, Seek Justice March") is an ongoing political campaign led by Gandhi and the INC [8][35]. Often referred to as the Nyay Yatra ("Justice March") [36], it aims to address issues such as economic disparity and ethnic clashes [10]. This Yatra spans 14-15 states, covering a substantial distance of approximately 6,200-6,713 kilometers over roughly 66 days [10][37]. The Yatra seeks to understand the challenges faced by various groups, including the poor, laborers, farmers, women, youth, backward classes, Dalits, tribals, and minorities [38]. It is designed to traverse a large number of Lok Sabha and Assembly segments, making it a crucial political engagement [37]. The Yatra emphasizes the delivery of justice to all, transcending political affiliations, against what it describes as a rising tide of injustice and hatred [25].
In addition to these Yatras, Gandhi has also launched the **Voter Adhikar Yatra** in Bihar [11]. This Yatra, covering a significant distance, focuses on voter rights [11]. However, it has also faced controversy, with allegations of irregularities in voter lists [39]. Gandhi has also alleged vote fraud in specific assembly segments [11].

# Stance on Key Issues

Rahul Gandhi, as a prominent political figure, has taken stances on various key issues. He has recently voiced opposition to a Supreme Court directive regarding the removal of stray dogs from Delhi and the Delhi NCR, arguing that it represents a step backward from established humane policies [12].
Gandhi has also been a vocal critic of the Election Commission of India (ECI), alleging collusion with the BJP to manipulate voter rolls and elections [13] [40] [41]. These accusations have been met with strong rebuttals from the ECI, with Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar demanding either an affidavit to support the claims or an apology [14] [15] [16]. The ECI has deemed Gandhi's "vote theft" allegations as baseless and an insult to the Constitution [16] [42].
Furthermore, Gandhi is positioned as a leader focused on justice, as evidenced by initiatives like the Nyay Yatra, which aims to address injustice and hatred across 15 states [25].

# Public Image and Perception

Rahul Gandhi's public image has been a subject of considerable discussion and, at times, controversy, particularly in the context of Indian politics and media [19] [17]. Social media has played a significant role in shaping and disseminating perceptions of him, especially during elections [20].
One recurring aspect of his public image is the nickname "Pappu," which gained traction in the lead-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections [21] [43]. This moniker, which translates to "naive" or "immature," was widely used by political opponents, particularly from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and their supporters [21] [43]. Some reports suggest the term originated earlier [44]. Gandhi himself has acknowledged and even referenced the "Pappu" image on occasion, seemingly to counter it and project a more relatable persona [45].
Gandhi has claimed that significant resources have been deployed to damage his image over the years [23]. Some observers allege that the media is manipulated by the government to provide favorable coverage to the ruling BJP [19] [46]. Conversely, the Congress party and its supporters have accused the media of bias against Rahul Gandhi [17]. Some have even alleged censorship and hacking of online content related to Gandhi [24].
Despite the negative portrayals, some observers suggest that Gandhi's image has evolved, particularly after events like the Bharat Jodo Yatra and interviews at universities [22]. The Indian National Congress (INC), the party to which Gandhi belongs, has deep roots in India and was a key player in the country's independence movement [47] [2].

# Controversies and Criticisms

Rahul Gandhi has faced various controversies and criticisms throughout his political career. Recent criticisms have focused on his allegations of voter fraud and his approach to electoral discrepancies [17].

## Allegations of Voter Fraud

Gandhi has accused the Election Commission (EC) of India of electoral fraud, alleging widespread voter manipulation during the 2024 parliamentary elections [18]. He has cited data obtained from the electoral body to support his claims [18]. Specifically, he alleged over 100,000 fake voters in a single Karnataka constituency [48]. These accusations have been described by some as "vote chori" [17]. The Election Commission, through CEC Gyanesh Kumar, has refuted these allegations, terming them baseless and misleading to the public, undermining faith in the electoral process [16]. The opposition has also pointed to discrepancies such as a large number of new voters appearing shortly after the federal election in a state where the BJP lost [49]. Similar allegations have been made regarding the Lok Sabha election in Karnataka [49].

## Criticism of Focus

YSRCP chief YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has criticized Rahul Gandhi for his silence on alleged voting discrepancies in Andhra Pradesh, questioning why Gandhi is focusing on electoral issues elsewhere while seemingly ignoring the vote count differences in Andhra [50].

## Debate on Motives

Gandhi's accusations against the Election Commission have sparked debate on whether they represent a genuine concern for democracy or a political strategy for a comeback [51]. Some view his actions as an attack on the credibility of the Election Commission [52]. The role of the media in scrutinizing these claims has also been highlighted [17].

# Personal Life

Information regarding Rahul Gandhi's personal life is relatively limited in publicly available news reports. However, the "Bharat Jodo Yatra" was described by Gandhi as "the most beautiful and deep experience of my life" [26].
