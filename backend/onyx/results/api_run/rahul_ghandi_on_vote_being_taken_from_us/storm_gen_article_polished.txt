# Overview

In August 2025, Rahul Gandhi, Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha [18] [19], intensified his criticism regarding the integrity of the Indian electoral process, alleging large-scale electoral fraud in the 2024 elections [20]. Gandhi launched a "Vote Adhikaar Yatra" (Vote Rights Journey) [4] [1] and presented what he claimed was "evidence" of "vote theft," specifically citing an Assembly constituency in Karnataka [5]. He also accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Minister Amit Shah of involvement [1].
Gandhi's allegations included claims that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the Bangalore Central Lok Sabha seat in the previous year through massive voter fraud [8]. He further expanded his accusations to include the states of Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh [21]. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has faced scrutiny, with Gandhi suggesting the ECI has "disappeared" [22] and accusing it of "treason" [21]. Yogendra Yadav stated that the ECI's response to Gandhi's allegations was "threatening" and that the ECI was not taking up an inquiry [14].
The Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) of Karnataka requested that Rahul Gandhi provide documents and a signed declaration to support his claims [23]. The BJP has strongly condemned Gandhi's statements regarding the Election Commission [13].

# Allegations of Vote Manipulation

In the aftermath of the 2024 parliamentary elections, Rahul Gandhi, Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha [24][17], has made strong allegations of widespread voter manipulation [2][3]. These allegations, often referred to as "Vote Chori" (vote theft) [6][25], center around claims of irregularities in electoral rolls, including the addition of fake voters, deletion of genuine voters, and creation of duplicate identification cards [6].
Gandhi has cited granular data, purportedly obtained from the Election Commission of India (ECI) itself, to support his claims [2][3]. He specifically pointed to the Mahadevapura Assembly segment within the Bangalore Central parliamentary constituency, alleging that the voter list contained over 100,000 manipulated entries [3][7], including duplicate voters, invalid addresses, and bulk registrations at single locations [3][26]. Gandhi claimed that this manipulation contributed to the BJP's victory in the Bangalore Central Lok Sabha seat [8][7][9]. He stated that 100,250 votes were "stolen" through various methods, including 11,965 duplicate voters, 40,009 voters with fake or invalid addresses, and 10,452 bulk registrations [27].
The ECI has demanded evidence from Gandhi to substantiate his claims of voter fraud in Karnataka [10][11]. They have stated that such charges must be supported by evidence and pursued through the proper legal channels [10]. The Karnataka CEO has also requested documentary evidence from Gandhi regarding his allegations [28]. The ECI and the ruling party have disputed Gandhi's interpretation of the electoral data [3][25]. Following the allegations, Gandhi claimed that the election commission websites of some states were taken down [29]. He demanded complete access to the electronic voter list for the entire country, along with video records [29]. Gandhi has also criticized the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of voter lists in Bihar, claiming it is a method to steal votes [16][4].

# Responses

Following Rahul Gandhi's allegations of widespread voter fraud in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections [15], the Election Commission of India (ECI) has demanded evidence to substantiate his claims [10][11]. The ECI has countered Gandhi's accusations, explaining issues such as voters with zero as house numbers and duplication in voter lists, asserting that these do not necessarily indicate fraud and vouching for the sanctity of the electoral process [12]. The Karnataka CEO has also requested Gandhi to provide documentary evidence for his allegations of voter fraud in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls [28].
Some observers, like Yogendra Yadav, have criticized the ECI's "threatening" response to Rahul Gandhi's allegations, suggesting that instead of issuing threats, the ECI should conduct an inquiry [14]. Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi expressed "hesitation and unease" regarding the ECI's reaction to Gandhi's press conference [30].
The ECI's response included a demand for a signed declaration or apology from Gandhi regarding his voter fraud claims [31]. The ECI has also emphasized the importance of maintaining electoral integrity and has stated that allegations must be pursued through the proper process [10].

# Legal and Regulatory Framework

The preparation of electoral rolls in India is a constitutional responsibility of the Election Commission of India (ECI)[32], which is entrusted with conducting free and fair elections [33]. For every assembly constituency, an electoral roll is prepared under the superintendence, direction, and control of the ECI [34]. The Central Government has the power to promulgate rules regarding the registration of electors, such as the Registration of Electors Rules (RER), 1960 [35]. Rule 20(3)(b) of the RER, 1960, requires a declaration or oath to be signed and returned [36]. Once amendments are made to the electoral roll for a constituency, the registration officer may integrate them for convenience [37]. The ECI also issues various instructions and guidelines related to the electoral process [35]. Citizens have the right to appeal and seek redress if their rights are taken away [38]. Allegations of voter fraud and irregularities in electoral rolls can be challenged through legal avenues [39].

# Analysis and Interpretation

Rahul Gandhi, a prominent political figure in India, has recently made allegations of "criminal fraud" and "vote theft" related to the Election Commission of India (ECI) and the 2024 Lok Sabha polls [17] [15] [40]. These allegations have sparked considerable debate and controversy [15]. Gandhi's presentation on the workings of the Election Commission has been described as "explosive" [40]. He has specifically questioned the integrity of voter lists and alleged the destruction of video evidence [41].
The Election Commission has responded to these allegations, stating that such charges must be substantiated by evidence and pursued through proper processes [10]. Some sources indicate that the ECI is analyzing data related to the allegations [42] [43]. The ECI's reaction to Gandhi's claims has been described by some as "threatening," further fueling the controversy [14].
These allegations have also inadvertently highlighted the importance of the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of voter lists, a process that has faced opposition from some political allies [16]. The credibility of the Election Commission hinges not only on its technical capabilities but also on public confidence in its impartiality and transparency [17]. Some argue that the ECI's response to the allegations, rather than initiating an inquiry, only reinforces concerns [14].
